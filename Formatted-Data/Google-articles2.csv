The only method in use for searching such documents involves first having them typed into standard computer text, a costly and time-consuming process.  ",2004-12-30T05:00:00+0000

It's also soared since the cease-fire and Israel's decision to withdraw from Gaza.    The simultaneous boomlets in the Israeli and Palestinian stock markets highlight one of the most important political facts I encountered traveling in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank: a groundswell of relief that both sides have found a way, even temporarily, to stop the insane cycle of Palestinian suicide bombing and Israeli retaliations that totally distorted daily life here. Quite simply, Israelis and Palestinians are really enjoying this calm after four years of mutually assured destruction. Palestinian restaurants in Ramallah are full again.

" Questions Turn to How Google Will Spend $4 Billion From Offering  Because of Google's stated mission of ''organizing the world's information and making it universally accessible and useful,'' it could disappoint those who are expecting it to make a blockbuster acquisition with cash from a new stock offering. Indeed, its acquisitions to date have exclusively been of small technology start-ups led by designers Google wanted to hire. That is a marked contrast to its two main competitors, Microsoft and Yahoo, which have turned to high-profile acquisitions to enter new markets.

Demanding professionals use equipment similar to what was used to make the old photograph, and try to mimic exactly the framing, time of day and other salient aspects of the original picture.

"Shares of Baidu.com, China's most-used Internet search engine, plunged 28 percent after analysts from two firms that managed the company's initial public offering said the stock was overpriced. The shares, which closed Wednesday at $81.32, have a ''fair value'' around $27 to $45, Anthony Noto, a Goldman Sachs analyst, wrote in a note to clients. Mr. Noto started coverage of the company with a rating of underperform. Baidu's stock had more than quadrupled since its initial offer Aug. 5 on expectations that it could maintain its lead in China over Google, the world's biggest search engine company and No.2 in China. Competitive pressure and the possibility of copyright infringement and increasing regulation by the Chinese government create risks for Baidu, Mr. Noto wrote. ''We are not able to justify the current valuation of the stock, even when evaluating more aggressive scenarios,'' he wrote. A Piper Jaffray analyst, Safa Rashtchy, also started coverage with an underperform rating, saying the shares would decline to $45 because the current price is ''unsustainable.''

"ALMOST every significant American economic era is apparent in this neat-as-a-pin city on the western shore of Lake Michigan. Its agrarian heritage is reflected in the farms lying at the city's edge, and a beer-malting plant at the center of town. The maritime and industrial eras are represented by a coal-fired ferry that crosses Lake Michigan, and the steel cranes built here by the 103-year-old Manitowoc Company. The rust belt period, with its manufacturing-job losses and downtown decline, is still felt in slow population growth, modest housing prices and shuttered plants.      In the newest era of this city's history, the Internet is propping up bricks and mortar downtown, acting as a mainstay for the stores that have helped Manitowoc establish what development specialists call a ''recreational'' shopping experience. Indeed, besides generating sales for giants like Amazon, the Internet is allowing small stores, here and around the country, to develop the niche products that shield them against big-box retailers.

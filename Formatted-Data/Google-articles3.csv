Yet I hope Google finds some way to proceed with and even add to its Book Search program, and work out its differences with the world of hard-copy print media (''Googling Literature: The Debate Goes Public,'' Arts pages, Nov. 18).

A1    In private conversations, American officials are beginning to acknowledge that a judgment about when withdrawals from Iraq can begin is driven by two political calendars -- one in Iraq and one in the United States -- as much as by military assessments. The final decision could hinge on whether the new Iraqi government, scheduled to be elected in less than three weeks, issues its own call for an American pullout.   A1    Graft Endangers Caspian Fish  Although international and domestic regulations protect the sturgeon on paper, manifest lawlessness and graft in the Caspian region have led to unchecked fishing and struggling hatcheries.

A1    Iran Hit by Powerful Quake  A powerful earthquake hit southern Iran, causing major destruction in seven villages, killing 10 people and injuring 80. The tremor shook Oman and the United Arab Emirates as well, forcing many office workers to evacuate their buildings.   A6    Banned Egyptian Party Gains  The banned Muslim Brotherhood has demonstrated in the latest Parliamentary elections that it is by far the strongest Egyptian opposition group, trouncing the secular political opposition and weakening the governing party's power monopoly.   A3    Zimbabwe Party Shows Power  Zimbabwe's ruling party predictably appeared assured of an overwhelming victory as officials tallied the results of a record low turnout in this weekend's election for the newly created upper house of Parliament.

A13    Catholics Split on Gay Priests  Grappling with the implications of a Vatican directive issued last week that would bar most gay men from seminaries, Roman Catholics at parishes around the country offered contrasting interpretations of its impact on the priesthood, on the potential for future sexual abuse by clergy members and on the church itself.   A13    Golf and Archaeology Clash  The Newark Earthworks, a sprawling and complex series of earthen mounds sculpted by the Hopewell Indians 2,000 years ago, is now home of the Moundbuilders Country Club.

That group, the nonprofit Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, helped transform the park into one of the city's most heavily used and beloved public spaces. But a major concern has come with the transformation: that Bryant Park is being operated in such a businesslike fashion -- including charging fees for holding events, and allowing corporate sponsorships -- that it barely seems like a public space anymore.

" INTERNATIONAL   A3-14    As Many 130 Are Killed In Explosions in Iraq  Suicide bombers and a roadside explosion killed as many as 130 people in Iraq, rekindling fears of a return to mass sectarian killings after a relative lull and prompting the country's most powerful Shiite political faction to warn of retribution and to indirectly blame the United States for the bloodshed.   A1    The top American operational commander in Iraq has offered a sober assessment of the hurdles facing a new Iraqi government, voicing concerns that sectarian rivalries and incompetence may turn newly trained Iraqi security forces into militias for hire.   A10    President Bush met with a collection of cabinet members from the current and past administrations in an effort to bring some of his critics into the fold and provide bipartisan common ground to the strategy he has laid out in recent weeks for Iraq.

A1    The Bush administration, planning for a Middle East without Mr. Sharon, expressed hope that Israel would still follow Mr. Sharon's policies. But The White House faces difficult choices on how to make sure that happens.   A12    Doctors in Jerusalem operated on Mr. Sharon's brain for a total of seven hours, then put him into an anesthesia-induced coma and connected him to a respirator, his medical team said. The steps were desperate and, experts said, unlikely to work.   A12    Reaction in the Arab world was mixed, as some officials said that Mr. Sharon had been creating momentum toward peace in Gaza, while some ordinary Arabs were happy that their longtime nemesis may finally be neutralized.

A1    Miner's Missives Offer Resolve  In four faint sentences of farewell and religious conviction, the words of Martin Toler Jr.'s note and similar missives from other miners, who were found dead in the wake of an unexplained explosion, offered a coda, at once heartbreaking and strangely consoling, to the emotional maelstrom of the past four days.

" EYES ON ENRON -- Trials of former corporate superstars have become so commonplace in recent years that their dramatic arc is by now well known. But the sheer scale of Enron's rise and collapse is likely to make the trial of two of its former chief executives, Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, a whole different kind of theater. The trial begins today in Houston.    A FEW MORE FED MINUTES -- Alan Greenspan turns over the post of Federal Reserve chairman to Ben S. Bernanke tomorrow. Fed policy makers are meeting the same day and are expected to raise interest rates for the 14th consecutive time. Economists say that the Fed may not see the need for more increases in the next few months, an expectation that has helped lift the stock market recently.    BY THE BARREL -- Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries begin a meeting in Vienna tomorrow, and ministers have indicated that they are likely to keep pumping oil at current levels. Iran may say, however, that it plans to keep some of its oil off the market in response to criticism of its nuclear efforts.

"Exxon Mobil, aided by strong energy prices, disclosed Monday that it had set a record for profits among American companies, reporting $36 billion in annual income. But while most companies would be proud to trumpet record profits, Exxon Mobil did everything it could to play down the news.      For Exxon Mobil, which also handily widened its lead over Wal-Mart as the company with the largest revenues in the nation, the report was an embarrassment of riches. Anxious about criticism of the results, executives began laying the groundwork months ago to try to prevent a political reaction against the company and the energy industry.

"The proposed $67 billion megamerger between AT&T and BellSouth requires the scrutiny of regulators, in particular because it would continue the rapid reconsolidation of the old AT&T monopoly. The company has a strong argument for the deal, because the technological landscape is now completely different from the one in 1984, when Ma Bell was broken up -- as different as a rotary-dial phone tethered to a land line is from a cellphone with a wireless headset.      But this merger also raises important questions about the future of the Internet itself, and about how much giant companies like AT&T will be allowed to control access to it. The health and future of the economy depend on the Internet's remaining a level playing field. So AT&T should be prevented from violating the principle of Internet neutrality, which holds that consumers should be given equal access to Web sites. Regulators must demand it from AT&T as a condition of this deal, and Congress should enact a law ensuring that it applies across the board.  ",2006-03-08T05:00:00+0000

"The third rail in the transportation business is the electrified conduit that supplies power to a railway. Pension reform, so the saying goes, is the third rail of politics: Grab it and you die. The need to adapt state-financed retirement systems to changing demographics is acute, but so are the vested interests at all points on the political spectrum - which is one reason elected governments from Washington to Warsaw have resisted tackling the issue. So the announcement this week that the British government was proposing to overhaul its pension system was an illustration of just how bleak the future of social security systems has become, and how change can no longer be postponed. It also represents a significant political compromise between Prime Minister Tony Blair and his chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, over how to swell the coffers of the British pension system, which has one of the lowest payouts in Europe. That Blair, who faces serious political troubles over Iraq, should now be willing to grab the third rail is not too surprising: As one of the characters in ""The West Wing,"" a television show about the inner workings of a fictional White House, put it, that is where the power is.",2006-05-26T05:00:00+0000

"EVER since the first Prius rolled off the assembly line almost a decade ago at the Takaoka plant not far from Toyota City, hybrid cars have basically been a luxury item. If you owned one, you could feel good about using less gasoline and being a trendsetter, but you couldn't expect the fuel savings to make up for the thousands of extra dollars that the hybrid cost. There was no financial reward for environmental virtue.     But in the last few months, something important has changed. Gas prices have settled in at close to $3 a gallon, which is enough to make a few hybrids almost worth it, if not quite. And since the start of the year, the federal government has been giving generous tax credits to hybrid buyers, pushing the Prius and a couple of other hybrids into bargain territory.

For example, it does not remember addresses, so users need to tell it where they live every time they want driving directions.  ",2006-07-24T05:00:00+0000

" INTERNATIONAL   A3-11    Israel Mulls Outside Force To Patrol Lebanon Border  As Israel pounded southern Lebanon and the Hezbollah militia rained dozens more rockets on Israel's north, diplomatic efforts increased with growing discussion of a multinational armed force being set up in the area. The Israeli prime minister spoke of a force consisting of European Union members with combat experience and the authority to take control of Lebanon's border and crossing points.   A1    Israeli warplanes hit civilians escaping by vehicle from their villages in southern Lebanon at least six times in a series of fierce bombardments, witnesses and officials said. Lebanese Red Cross ambulance drivers complained about narrowly avoiding Israeli fire as they cleared out the wounded, and a Lebanese photographer was killed when an Israeli missile struck near her car. A1    Saudis Urge Cease-Fire  A delegation from Saudi Arabia asked President Bush to push for a cease-fire in the war between Israel and the terrorist group Hezbollah. The foreign minister said he delivered a letter from the Saudi king, Abdullah, with suggestions for ending the violence. It met a cool reception from American Officials.  A8    Syrian Calls U.S. Course Faulty  The Bush administration's approach of indirectly pressuring Syria to drop support for Hezbollah is doomed to failure, said Bthaina Shaaban a top Syrian minister. Washington, she says, is ignoring reality if it thinks groups like Hezbollah and Hamas can be purged by allowing Israel to bomb at will.  A9    Recruitment Troubles in Iraq  Recruiting a new police force to battle the insurgents in Iraq has become a central element in the United States' plan to reduce American forces. American commanders face securing a modicum of cooperation from a wary population, and to contend with a campaign by insurgents to assassinate and intimidate the members of Iraq's fledgling security services.  A10    Saddam Hussein was hospitalized after a hunger strike, and was being fed with a tube and given tests to ensure that he could continue to attend his trial, Iraqi and American officials said. Widespread sectarian violence returned after two days of relative calm, with at least 57 people killed in bombings in Baghdad and Kirkuk.  A11    Artist Shadowed by Nazi Ties  After years of obscurity, the first publicly financed exhibit since World War II of the work of Arno Breker, the German sculptor whose art so vividly expressed Nazi ideology that he became known as ''Hitler's favorite sculptor,'' is being mounted in Schwerin, Germany. The exhibit has ignited a debate in a region which has had a spurt of far-right and neo-Nazi political activity recently.  A3    NATIONAL A12-15    U.S. to Limit Payments For Victims of Disaster  The Department of Homeland Security, responding to months of criticism and ridicule, will sharply cut back on emergency cash assistance for victims of major disasters, and more carefully control access to free hotel rooms. Immediate emergency aid would not exceed $500 in cash instead of $2,000 per family under the new rules.  A1    Bar Association Critical of Bush  The American Bar Association said President Bush was flouting the Constitution and undermining the rule of law by claiming the power to disregard selected provisions of bills that he signed. In a comprehensive report, a bipartisan panel of the bar association said Mr. Bush had used such ''signing statements'' far more than his predecessor.  A12    Sunday Services in Parks  From Memorial Day to Labor Day, 42 state, national and private parks in Pennsylvania hold nondenominational Christian worship services. The chaplains come from local towns and faraway states, as do the worshipers, mostly Protestants. Last year, 18,000 people attended services in Pennsylvania parks.  A13    Elderly Katrina Victims Struggle  Thousands of elderly Hurricane Katrina evacuees still struggle to get by in cities hundreds of miles from their home in New Orleans. But more than most evacuees, it is the elderly who want most to return, say social service workers, and who have the hardest time doing so.  A12    F.D.A. to Limit Industry Ties  The Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce an effort to write guidelines detailing the kind of industry ties that are permitted for those who serve on its powerful advisory boards. The agency hopes to appease critics who have complained that board members often have such deep financial ties to drug makers that their advice is tainted.  A13    SCIENCE/HEALTH    Stomach Surgery Called Risky  Four of every 10 patients who undergo weight-loss surgery develop complications within six months, the federal government said. The number of such surgical procedures has been rising rapidly, along with the incidence of obesity, which now afflicts 30 percent of adults in the United States, health officials said.

B1    Campaign Draws Big Names  With their race quickly becoming a national symbol of rifts in the Democratic party, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman and his challenger, Ned Lamont, are turning to national political stars to help bolster each of their campaigns, apparently hoping that the big names can help turn out votes in the coming primary for the Senate.  B1    SPORTSMONDAY D1-8    Tiger Woods Wins British Open  Tiger Woods shot five-under-par 67 at the 135th British Open to win the 11th professional major championship of his career.

In Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes killed at least 16 people, according to Lebanese officials. A1    Efforts to speed adoption of a draft resolution to halt the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah faltered at the United Nations while sharp criticism of the measure rang out across the Middle East.

A10    Immigration Hearings Criticized  When House leaders announced their plan to hold 21 immigration hearings in 13 states, they said it demonstrated a commitment to securing the border.

A10    Nashville Murder Trial Starts  Perry March, 45, goes on trial, accused of murdering his wife, whose remains have not been found.

"Knowledge, Samuel Johnson once said, ''is of two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can find information upon it.'' The point behind every scheme for cataloging books -- and there are more schemes than you'd imagine -- is to make the second kind of knowledge easier to come by. Most experienced library users know the Library of Congress classification system, at least in its outlines. But the reference collection in the Main Reading Room at the New York Public Library follows the Billings system, created by a former director of the library and used nowhere else. It is a map on which you recognize none of the symbols.     That is all changing, at last. The reference collection is being reshelved according to the Library of Congress system. In the overall history of information science, this may seem like a leap from the 1890's to the late 1890's. But a classification system is like a shark. If it isn't moving forward, it's probably dead. Perhaps the most delightfully named branch of the federal bureaucracy is the Library of Congress Cataloging Directorate, which sounds oddly like an office of totalitarian librarians. One division of the Cataloging Directorate does nothing but keep the classification system up to date. The same cannot be said of the Billings system, which suffered obsolescence long ago.

"I learned to drive in a state where the roads are laid out in a square-mile grid. The town I learned to drive in was laid out in a grid too, except for a single, exotic, curving street. The landscape itself was a compass of sorts, and nearly all the adults I knew -- especially the farmers -- spoke of it that way. As a result, I grew up with a keen sense of direction, which is a liability only when I actually get lost. That happens once or twice a year, usually in the mildew hollows of eastern Connecticut and usually when my wife and I are already late for dinner. I get angry at myself for being lost. My wife gets angry at me for getting angry. The only solution is to get found.      Recently, I rented a car in Kansas, a state that, in the eastern sections at least, is less gridlike than it looks. I planned to do a lot of back-road driving, but I didn't have time to print up a stack of Google maps, and I didn't have a Kansas Gazetteer either. So, on a whim, I asked for a car with a G.P.S. guidance system. I knew all about the technology behind G.P.S. -- the array of satellites overhead, the tracking stations, the reliance on minute differences in time to calculate position. I own an old G.P.S. that thinks the world is a blank gray slate on which you can trace your footsteps. But I had never used one of the new generation of automotive navigation tools, which include a database of detailed road maps. Now that I have, I'm not sure I'll ever leave home without one.

" INTERNATIONAL A3-11    Sudan Fighting Threatens Wider African Conflict  A visit to the site of the newest fighting in Sudan revealed a hardening conflict that is increasingly taking place along porous borders among some of the least stable countries in Africa, threatening to ignite a wide conflagration in the heart of the continent.   A1    Sudan's government ordered the chief United Nations envoy out of the country, saying he was an enemy of the country and its armed forces. Secretary General Kofi Annan said he was reviewing the letter from the Khartoum government and had asked the envoy, Jan Pronk, to return to New York for ''consultations.''   A11    18 Killed in Iraqi Violence  A deadly ambush of police recruits north of Baghdad and multiple bombings against shoppers in the capital put a violent stamp on the preparations for the Muslim celebration marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan.

A1    A Costly Kansas Town  A breakdown of new Census Bureau data shows that housing costs have risen as a burden in almost every part of the country since 2000.

B7    Quicker Citizenship, for Some  Officials of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services say they have shrunk the average wait for a citizenship decision to five months.

" INTERNATIONAL A3-11    Iraqi Court Sentences Hussein to Death  Three and a half years after American troops captured Baghdad and ended the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi court set up to judge the brutalities of his 24 years in power sentenced him to death by hanging after finding him guilty of crimes against humanity.  A1    The death penalty for Mr. Hussein and two of his co-defendants brought jubilation to Shiite and Kurdish neighborhoods across Iraq, gloom to Sunni ones, and a political blessing for its current, embattled prime minister.   A11    Taiwan's Leader Admits Lies  President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan admitted he submitted false receipts for reimbursement from public funds and lied to prosecutors about how he spent the money, but said he had done so in the interest of national security.   A6    China Sets African Trade Deals  China and a number of African nations agreed on 16 trade and investment deals valued at $1.9 billion, as Beijing extended its efforts to create a broad economic and diplomatic partnership with Africa.   A6    Nicaraguans Vote for Leader  Nicaraguans went to the polls to choose a new president in a five-way contest that primarily focused on one contender: Daniel Ortega, the former Marxist president who fought American-backed contras in a bloody war in the 1980s.   A8    Israel Firm on Gaza Offensive  Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel said the military would not halt its offensive in the northern Gaza Strip until Palestinian rocket fire toward Israel was reduced.  A11    Snag for Kosovo Independence  The hopes of ethnic Albanians that Kosovo would be granted independence by the end of this year were placed in doubt as Secretary General Kofi Annan said a decision on the future of the United Nations-administered province could be delayed.   A8    Turk Hints at Freer Speech  Prime Minister Recep Erdogan of Turkey signaled he was prepared to amend a law limiting free speech, a surprise move that was apparently an 11th-hour attempt to prevent a crisis with the European Union over Turkey's troubled membership talks.   A8    NATIONAL A12-19    G.O.P. Finds Issues For Rallying Its Voters  President Bush seized on the sentencing of Saddam Hussein as a ''milestone'' in Iraq, seeking to rally Republican voters with the issue of national security as some polls suggested that his party might be making gains in the final hours of the campaign. The White House said the timing of the announcement, two days before Election Day, had nothing to do with American politics.   A1    Campaigning Coast to Coast  To inspire his troops on the last big day of campaigning for the midterm elections, Representative Mike Fitzpatrick, a Republican in his first term, pulled out a favorite weapon of Republican candidates in the same predicament: Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican whose reputation as a maverick makes him an appealing attraction.   A17    In one of the tightest races in the country, Indiana's Ninth Congressional District, an important economic concern, high gasoline prices, has been somewhat alleviated in the past few weeks as the price at the pump has edged down.   A17    A new poll, which queried 400 likely voters and was published by The Miami Herald, found that 49 percent said they preferred the Democratic challenger, State Senator Ron Klein, to Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr. , who drew the support of 40 percent of respondents.   A17    As volunteers lined up to carry the last paper sacks of leaflets into a web of suburbs to the west of Chicago, Iraq loomed over the tense race for the Congressional seat that is being vacated by Henry J. Hyde, a Republican.   A17    Many Candidates Unopposed  Though the Democrats need only 15 seats to take control of the House, 34 House candidates (30 Democrats and 4 Republicans) have no opponent at all.   A16    Minister Asks for Forgiveness  Thousands of people gathered at the Colorado Springs church whose founder, Ted Haggard, was dismissed for ''sexually immoral conduct.'' Speakers urged the church's members to find a way forward without recrimination or bitterness; a letter from Mr. Haggard was read from the 8,000-seat auditorium's center stage, urging forgivness for the Denver man who broke the story.   A12    NEW YORK/REGION B1-8    Final Political Push Is Felt By Voters in New Jersey  Volunteers bounded from door to door, the airwaves filled with advertisements and carefully chosen political celebrities popped up across New Jersey as the state became a battlefield for both parties in the final days of the midterm campaign. With Democrats appearing within reach of gaining the six seats they need to take control of the United States Senate, New Jersey has become a focus of national attention. B1    State Republicans Cry Foul  Anticipating historic political losses in New York on Election Day, state Republican leaders are lashing out at the national party in Washington, saying it has exploited New York donors and missed opportunities against a prime target, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. They say that, despite pleas for help, they have been ignored in Washington.  B1    Cigarette Trade in Jeopardy  The tax-free sale of steeply discounted cigarettes by the Shinnecock Indian Outpost in Southampton is what keeps the tribe alive. But now the cigarette trade is being threatened by both a federal lawsuit and an expected push by the New York State government, which estimates it loses $576 million a year in the sale of untaxed cigarettes.  B1    Brooklyn Development Faulted  Even in Greenpoint-Williamsburg, an area familiar with growth and gentrification, the sweeping changes wrought by the city's rezoning have left many residents feeling dizzied, and there is a sense that the government has not moved fast enough to keep pace with developers.  B1    Neediest Cases  B6    ARTS E1-10    Students Build in Mississippi  Architects in training at Parsons the New School for Design volunteered for six weeks of rugged work in hurricane-ravaged Mississippi, conceiving and building a combination information center and laundromat. E1    World War II Photos Unearthed  Close to 800 images by the photographer Dorothea Lange depicting the World War II-era internment of Japanese and Japanese-American citizens have been unearthed in the National Archives, where they had lain neglected for a half-century after being impounded by the government.  E1    BUSINESS DAY C1-10    Medicare and Democrats  Democrats, who have long charged that the drug industry is profiteering at taxpayers' expense, say they want to introduce legislation to revoke the law that bars Medicare from negotiating prices directly with drug makers like Pfizer for the medicines it buys.   C1    Studios Seek Concessions  Movie and television studios, facing escalating budgets, rampant piracy and the uncertain future of new media, are demanding concessions from actors, directors and writers.

" TRYING TO REGULATE AN ARMY -- For years, companies including Avon Products, Herbalife and Amway have prospered by building armies of part-time sales representatives promoting insurance plans and anti-aging creams. Those representatives, in turn, are encouraged to recruit others and are promised that they will receive a portion of new enlistees' profits. The companies profit, at least in part, by collecting increased revenue and fees paid by new sales representatives. In April, citing hundreds of fraud investigations, the Federal Trade Commission proposed new rules for multilevel marketing companies and related businesses. [Page C1.]    SHORTCUT TO FASHION -- For fashionistas in lower tax brackets, reproducing the latest hip look from Lindsay Lohan or Paris Hilton can mean endless clicking through online retail sites and hit-or-miss searches on Google or shopping engines like Shopping.com.

[C4.]    LIFE IN THE STUDIO -- In an era when producers, directors and popular actors are required to toe a stricter line, even Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer, is feeling the squeeze. His contribution to Disney cannot be underestimated. He has produced 17 films for the studio since 1991. They have brought in $5 billion. As part of a shift under Robert A. Iger, the new Disney chief executive, the studio pledged to make fewer films and focus on family-friendly movies that are marketable across all the company's businesses. That means Mr. Bruckheimer is now in the onscreen amusement park business.

But the Zune can do something that no other player can claim: it can locate other Zune players and wirelessly exchange content with a few touches of a big shiny button.

"Robert Nardelli, the former chief executive of The Home Depot, will receive $210 million in severance compensation, including $20 million in cash, as he departs the U.S. home-improvement chain. Nardelli, who earned $64 million over six years while at the helm of the company, was long the target of shareholders, who were unhappy with the company's declining share price and Nardelli's autocratic style. But Nardelli, who resigned Wednesday, is but the latest U.S. corporate chief to receive a lucrative golden handshake. Henry McKinnell, of Pfizer, took $213 million with him, and Philip Purcell of Morgan Stanley received $113 million. If there is any good news in this case, it is that Home Depot's shareholders were finally heard. They had been smoldering for years over Nardelli's dismissal of their concerns, which began coalescing in 2004 when the company changed the way it calculated long-term incentive pay for executives without telling investors. It came to a head in March, when the Corporate Library named Home Depot's board as one of the 11 worst executive pay offenders, and it blew over in May, when Nardelli decided to run the company's annual meeting alone, without his directors, and limit questions from shareholders. Investors believe Nardelli's departure will lead to changes within the company, and say that some measures have already been undertaken. But is it realistic to think that other companies will get the message, as some observers hope? Why didn't they get the message — that chief executives should pay attention to shareholder wealth, not just their own — when Purcell, McKinnell or Tom Freston, of Viacom, were shown the door?

"I have no memory of the 1960’s and the ’70’s. These tumultuous years bear significant meaning to generations that went before me; yet, the decade lives on with its oldies classics, lunar missions, Vietnamization, and civil rights struggle. One way or another, everyone is captured through the Austin Powers throwbacks, English discussions of The Kind of Light that Shines on Texas, or history readings of two important, yet short-lived presidencies. Back then,the new millennium was anything left to the imagination of those who studied hard and led America to success in recent years. Nowadays, the sixties are more or less the imagination of us college students. If there was ever an adage to come true, it was that history tends to repeat itself.",2007-09-24T00:00:00+0000
"Growing up, we were bombarded with images of college life and the importance of higher education. By eighteen, we developed expectations and set standards for ourselves far beyond the expectations and standards that our parents faced upon entering adulthood. The modern application process alone forced us to thoroughly assess ourselves and our long-term goals. As if this wasn’t enough, we evaluated our own strengths, weaknesses, and dreams, in light of those of our peers, and perhaps even manipulated them, so that we might have a chance, just a chance, at being considered for admission to a competitive university. Most of us were fortunate enough to have had the emotional and financial support of our parents to brace us through the process; however, the average parent is incapable of pulling enough strings to secure a successful future for his or her child. College goers of today must accept a reality that is unfamiliar to our parents: Brains and determination, alone, cannot guarantee success. However, also unlike our parents, we do not take no for an answer.",2007-09-24T00:00:00+0000
"College today is vastly different than it was in the 1960’s and because of that mainstream America is just not all that interested in campuses. That’s the point Rick Perlstein hopes to prove in his New York Times piece “What’s the Matter with College?” It’s a point that isn’t really all that revolutionary, lest of all from someone nostalgically recalling their own college days. Sure, readers are shown that students today are more career-obsessed than their parents but what really matter is why students have changed and how that change might actually be beneficial to a knowledge society.",2007-09-24T00:00:00+0000

Intelligent and intellectually rebellious was cool.",2007-09-24T00:00:00+0000
"Before I begin, I have the intense need to clarify “college experience”, for it is a poor synonym for what is at stake.

"In What’s the Matter with College? Rick Perlstien states that the famed college experience as we know it is extinct. He implies that college campuses are wastelands devoid of creative thought and original thinking. They exist just out of legacy and serve as a stepping stone from high school into the job market. This statement is ill informed. Students and their respective universities need not reevaluate their current standing. The learning experience is still there, but students have to go about finding it in a different way. In the advent of modern technology, most young individuals know much more about themselves then their parents or grandparents did at the same age. Going about finding the right place to help you further your life goals is harder than it once was, but easier too.",2007-09-24T00:00:00+0000
